* list of TODO things!
** testing
   - [-] lots of test need to be written! (by someone)

** tensornetalgs
   - [-]  Best method for arnoldi and lanczos algorithms to make the
     process as seemlessly as possible (done with KrylovKit for now!
     but explore and test other choices)

   - [-] code algorithm such as TDVP, TEBD
     for undestanding and possible comparisons for later

   - [-] idmrg has some small issue still! Figure it out

   - [-] VUMPS (important!)

   - [-] MERA and play with GMERA
** symmetry stuff
   - [-] should the svd return be svd object to better integration
     with standard julia?

   - [-] implement the symmetry more general and also add the Z_2
     symmetry as an example (it is also incredibly useful)

   - [-] General clean-up

   - [-] how would the symmetry and charges play out in the case of
     infinte algorithms like iDMRG. Write iDMRG with symmetry

** QuantumModels
   - [-] code a general Model class so that you can use it to define
     models, what is the best approach and how can you make it better!
   - [-] need to write down spins in a more abstract way!
   - [-] integrate femionic and bosonic models.

** performance
   - [-] dmrg symmetric is still very slow! We need better contraction
   - [-] Read and think about Julia parallelization!
   - [-] performance improvements in getindex, etc ... using modifiers!
   - [-] compare different approached in making Hamiltonians for ED2imps

** General clean-ups
   - [-] mpogen need clean-up or better algorithm

** Fix complex real issues in a systematic fashion. HOW?
   - [-] More understanding of julia types is required

** revise
   - [-] discourage making SymTensors explicitely (how!) and don't
     check for stuff! This is somehow done by the definition of new
     constructors but need better stuff

   - [-] MPS and MPO need revision. i) local dimension needs to depend
     on sites ii) dims is needed or not? iii) combine sym and normal

   - [-] General combination of sym and none!
