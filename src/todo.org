* list of TODO things!
** testing
   - [-] lots of test need to be written! (by someone)

** idmrg and dmrg stuff
   - [-]  Best method for arnoldi and lanczos algorithms to make the
     process as seemlessly as possible (done with KrylovKit for now!
     but explore and test other choices)

   - [-] code algorithm such as TDVP, etc. at least the general case
     for undestanding and possible comparisons for later

** symmetry stuff
   - [-] the svd function needs revision, possibly the return value
     could be an svd object to better integration with standard julia

   - [-] implement the symmetry more general and also add the Z_2
     symmetry as an example (it is also incredibly useful)

   - [-] General clean-up

   - [-] how would the symmetry and charges play out in the case of
     infinte algorithms like iDMRG

** cools stuff
   - [-] code a general Model class so that you can use it to define
     models, what is the best approach and how can you make it better!

   - [-] MPO generator! This is very important.

** performance
   - [-] Read and think about Julia parallelization!
   - [-] performance improvements in getindex, etc ... using modifiers!

** General clean-ups
   - [-] name change and move all application operators for dmrg and
     related algorithms to some file for example "mpsapply.jl"

** Fix complex real issues in a systematic fashion. HOW?
