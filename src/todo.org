* list of TODO things!
** testing
   - [-] lots of test need to be written! (by someone)

** idmrg and dmrg stuff
   - [-]  Best method for arnoldi and lanczos algorithms to make the process
     as seemlessly as possible

   - [-] code algorithm such as TDVP, etc. at least the general case
     for undestanding and possible comparisons for later

** symmetry stuff
   - [-] the svd function needs revision, possibly the return value
     could be an svd object to better integration with standard julia

   - [-] implement the symmetry more general and also add the Z_2
     symmetry as an example (it is also incredibly useful)

   - [-] General clean-up

   - [-] how would the symmetry and charges play out in the case of
     infinte algorithms like iDMRG
